        <h2 class="my-3">Why do We Celebrate?</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p>Teaching is the most influential job in the world. Teachers are known to shape the mind of youth
                    and
                    without knowledge no one can exist in this world. Teacher imparts good value in children and
                    turn
                    them
                    into responsible citizens. So, almost every country celebrates Teacher's Day</p>
                <p>In India, we celebrate this day on the birthday of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. He was a man of
                    many
                    good qualities and a favorite teacher among students. It was his request that his birthday
                    should be
                    celebrated as an honorable day for all the teachers in the country, in case someone is wishing
                    to
                    celebrate his birthday at all. So, in a nutshell, we celebrate Teacher's Day because teachers
                    have
                    been
                    the architect of the society and without them no society can walk in the path of progression.

                </p>
                <p>In his book titled, "Political Thinkers of Modern India", he signified the importance of teachers
                    and
                    education in a country like Democratic India which was still in its early years of development.
                    According to him, there is a huge role of teachers in nation building and for that sake teachers
                    should
                    be respected more. Apart from being a thinker and teacher he was also a philosopher. He once
                    wrote a
                    book on Bhaagwad Gita and there he defined a teacher as, “The one who emphasizes on presentation
                    to
                    converge different currents of thoughts to the same end”.</p>
                <p>By the time he entered politics, most of the leaders of that time like Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma
                    Gandhi,
                    or Dr. Rajendra Prasad were his fans for this thinking in nation building. His skills were
                    proven in
                    the
                    arena of politics also. He had the political insight to recognize the impediments well in
                    advance
                    and
                    also carried the required courage to scold party leaders for their procrastination and
                    delinquency.
                    Way
                    back in 1947, he warned the former Congress people about the alarming consequences of nepotism
                    and
                    corruption. We are dealing with it now!</p>
                <p>Such a man of course requires a standing ovation. So, to promote the values and principles of a
                    true
                    teacher, this day is celebrated.</p>
